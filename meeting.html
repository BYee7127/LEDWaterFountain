			<ul>
				<li>Testing pumps with new power supply -- IT WORKS!!!!!!!!!</li>
				<li>Testing LEDs with new power supply -- IT WORKS.
					<ul>
						<li>Logic shifter needs a wire connecting 3.3V power to pin OE to enable it.</li>
						<li>Output to the LED comes out from pin B8.</li>
						<li>Input from the Teensy comes in from pin A8.
							<ul>
								<li>This wire was shifted from A8 to OE, which initially caused the NeoPixel not to work.</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Testing pumps and LEDs at the same time - IT WORKS
				</li>
				<li>More FFT work 
					<ul>
						<li>Need to adjust clock speed to 96MHz (recommended in Teensy documentation)
							<ul>
								<li>
									<a href="https://forum.pjrc.com/index.php?threads/how-to-change-clock-speed-on-teensy-4-0.57444/" target="_blank">Solution</a>
								</li>
								<li>Add following code to sketch:
									<pre>
// outside and above setup
#if defined(__IMXRT1062__)
extern "C" uint32_t set_arm_clock(uint32_t frequency);
#endif

// inside setup
#if defined(__IMXRT1062__)
  set_arm_clock(24000000);
  Serial.print("F_CPU_ACTUAL=");
  Serial.println(F_CPU_ACTUAL);
#endif</pre>
								</li>
							</ul>

			<ul></ul>

			2023-November-02
			<ul>
				<li>Goal for next week is to figure out what is wrong with the pumps and get them working.</li>
				<li>Measured and cut out holders for the lid and glued them to the enclosure.</li>
				<li>Trimmed and glued on the vinyl.</li>
				<li>Figured out fade in/out for the LEDs.</li>
				<li>Check-in with the Professor.</li>
			</ul>

			2023-October-31
			<ul>
				<li>Started the last prints for the enclosure - the dove tail joints and one last pin.</li>
				<li>Found a logic level shifter to use for the LED.</li>
				<li></li>
			</ul>

			2023-October-26
			<ul>
				<li>Discovered that the Teensy outputs 3.3v when the NeoPixel requires 5v logic.</li>
				<li></li>
			</ul>

			2023-October-24
			<ul>
				<li>Finished one speaker print and screwed one speaker to it.
					<ul>
						<li>This speaker is the one with the power cord outlet in the back and the AUX hole.</li>
						<li>Speaker hole is perfect fit.</li>
						<li>Screw holes are a bit of a tight fight but works well.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Test print of the service area.</li>
				<li>Re-arranged pins again for the LED.</li>
				<li>Testing pump pcp using the Teensy to make sure everything works.
					<ul>
						<li>The power supply we got for the pump pcp doesn't seem to be powerful enough for all the pumps together.</li>
						<li>Otherwise, all pumps do work.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>

			2023-October-19
			<ul>
				<li>Printing another joint test before printing speaker box to make sure it fits before printing the entire thing.</li>
				<li>Check-in meeting.</li>
				<li>Decided to use PWM on the Teensy instead.
					<ul>
						<li>It contains 17 PWM pins, more than enough to support all the pumps.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Glue the two pieces of the cover together.</li>
				<li>Began print of the speaker box with the aux and power holes.</li>
				<li>Re-soldered some of the pump wires to give more length.</li>
				<li>Tested the LED strip with the Teensy 4.0 - so far no good.
					<ul>
						<li><a href="https://gist.github.com/chemdoc77/8b50f86d3bef8e777ccca62759efbd2f" target="_blank">Sketch of code to run the LED strip (WS2811/RGB chip)</a></li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>

			2023-October-17
			<ul>
				<li>Check over fall break of the print revealed the print ran out of filament roughly halfway through.
					<ul>
						<li>Entirety of the stand printed okay.</li>
						<li>1 3/4" (44.45mm) of pool cover was printed - will need to have a seam as to not waste printed material (and thus money).</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Cut out the remaining part of the pool cover and created gcode to print.</li>
				<li>Began print of the remaining part of the pool cover.</li>
				<li>Continuing to read analog input through the Teensy.
					<ul>
						<li>Will need to clip the audio such that it doesn't read in all the random spikes.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Updated website.</li>
				<li>Continued fixing joint sizes.</li>
			</ul>
			
			2023-October-5
			<ul>
				<li>Presentation day</li>
				<li>Began print for the pool cover and stand (the main stand of the enclosure that holds up the trays).</li>
				<li>Need to reduce/increase size of certain joints (mostly all, though...).
					<ul>
						<li>[&#10003;] Reduce speaker side connection to pool stand.
							<ul>
								<li>Initial test had the joint come out the same size for both sides of the joint.</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>[&#10003;] Change pin size to: 4.5mm.
							<ul>
								<li>Intial print was a friction fit.</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>[&#10003;] Cut out holes for screws to speaker.</li>
						<li>[&#10003;] Cut out hole for AUX in one side of the speaker.</li>
						<li>[&#10003;] Cut out space for service area to go into for the speaker.</li>
						<li>[] Reduce size of the service area barrier</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>
			
			2023-October-3
			<ul>
				<li>Other group presentations</li>
				<li>Began 3D test print of connections and speaker hole.</li>
			</ul>
			
			2023-September-28
			<ul>
				<li>Did a test print of the top of the pool cover to check the size around the tray and the track.</li>
				<li>Due to the flimsiness of the top of the track, the decision was made to not use the track.
					<ul>
						<li>Instead, reduce the height of half of the pool cover by a little bit for the lid to sit on.</li>
						<li>Do the same for the rest of the encapsulation - will use previously bought flex tracks as holder for the lid.`</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li><b><u>Need to add a hole for the LED wires to come out.</u></b>
					<ul>
						<li>Size of hole from the tray is about 13mm x 13mm.</li>
						<li>Cut out a space from the top of the pool cover down to position of LED wires and make it 15mm wide.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Organized wires onto breadboard.</li>
			</ul>
			
			2023-September-26
			<ul>
				<li>Test printed a small version of the dovetail joint to make sure the gap between them is sufficient.
					<ul>
						<li>Need to take into account the orientation of the print for strength. The wrong direction will cause shearing.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>
			
			2023-September-21
			<ul>
				<li>3D printing designing.</li>
				<li>Attempted to do a 3D print of the sample dovetail join.

						<li>The memory card, in truth, used for the print was too large (64GB).</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>
			
			2023-September-19
			<ul>

			</ul>

			</ul>
			
			2023-August-31
			<ul>
				<li>Used Dremel to drill holes for tubes to feed through and for LED wires.</li>

			</ul>
			
			2023-August-29
			<ul>
				<li>Start doing presentations (presenting next week Thursday)</li>
				<li>Cleaned board and tray.</li>
				<li>Speakers are 8ohms (most likely; bought as a bulk item, so no datasheet)</li>
				<li>The library has 3D-scanning services, so can use that to get dimensions of speakers for stand.
					<ul>
						<li>Could also do it for the trays.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>

			2023-August-24
